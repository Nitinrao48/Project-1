what is the major difference between tuple and list are follows:


TUPLE : Tuple are the datatypes comes in python with its knowing feature of immutable property
which makes it differ from list datatype. for example: Here the values wont be change unless
what ever the situation arise.

List: on the other hand its play a role where values are immutable which means that can change easily
with the condition arisen.

ARRAY : Array are the special type of variable which holds multiple values in a single variable at 
the same time array are not in built feature of python .we can use list instead. Here are the couples of examples
we are using to define the array with the help of list. also there is not specialized library available
in the python so we will use numpy.

array main feature to store/ hold more than one value at single point of time.
and it is the part of data structure.

rather on the other hand string is charcter type datatype in python.

VARIABLE: Variable are containers for storing data values in it. python has no specific command to declare variable.
A variable in python created when a value assign to it.

let suppose x = 25
	and y = 2
so here x and y both are variable that holds different (25 and 2) value in it.

we can store more like wise same variable with they data element values into it. other thing we dont need to declare a particular type (datatype) like int, char, string
