To setup a Git and begin with installation then 

Install Git:
If you haven't already, download and install Git for Windows. You can find the installer here: 
https://git-scm.com/download/win

Set up Git:
After installation, open Git Bash or the Windows Command Prompt and configure your Git username
and email address if you haven't already. 
You can do this with the following commands:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Note down the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/reponame.git).

Create a Notepad file:
Create or save the Notepad file you want to push to GitHub. Ensure it's saved in a local directory 
on your computer.

Initialize a Git repository locally:

git init

Add and commit the Notepad file:

git add yourfile.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:

git remote add origin repository_url

Push your Notepad file to GitHub:

git push -u origin master

Check Existing Remotes:
You can check the existing remote repositories associated with your Git repository using the following command:

git remote -v

Rename or Remove the Existing Remote:

git remote remove origin

If you still want to keep the existing remote but give it a different name, you can use the following command to rename it:

git remote rename origin newname

Replace "newname" with the new name you want to use.

Use the Existing Remote:

git push -u origin master

Check Your Repository's Configuration:
Sometimes, the "origin" remote is configured in the repository's .git/config file. You can open this file and check if there 
are any custom configurations for the "origin" remote. If you find any, you can modify them as needed.

Create a Branch:

git checkout -b new-branch-name
