STARTING WITH LINUX
=========  ===========

LINUX: Linux is a kernel(work in between hardware and OS) work as operating system also. developed in 
       1969 at bell laboratories by dennis ritchie & ken thompson.

 EXAMPLES LIKE LINUX AND OTHER ITS FLAVOURS

UNIX: UNICS: Uniplesed information & computing services.

* Linux is kernel not OS
* It is not a UNIX derivative.it is different & wass wirtten from scratch.
* Linx distribution is the linux kernel and a collection of softwares that together create an OS.

FEATURES OF LINUX
==================

* It is open source(Available for everyone without any cost).
* It is secure as compare to other OS like windwos.
* It is light weight (Means do not required much space for installation like we need in windows OS)
* It is multiuser & multitasking operating system.
* Simplified updated for all installed softwares.
* Multiple distribution avalability -REDHAT, DEBIAN, FEDORA.

DIRECTORIES IN LINUX
=====================

* /Forward : Forward directory is a root directory denoted by a single forward slash (/). It is the
             upper most directory in the linux directory structure. It contains all the directories,
             sub- directories, and files on your linux system. its from the root directory where the
             linux hierarchy starts. The root directory (/) should not be confused with the root 
             home directory (/root).

1 /Home : Home directory of other users not root users.It contains user personal files & folders.
          On graphical linux systems ,the home directory, by default, contains folders such as
          Desktop,documents, Downloads, pictures,Videos and public.In addition, the /home directory 
          contains personal configuration files which are prefixed with a dot (.). 
          These are hidden files that contain user-specific settings for the login shell session.

2 /root : Home directory for root users or admin user.The /root directory is the home directory for 
          the root user, which is also referred to as the root user’s home directory 
          (and not as the root (/) directory).
          The root account also referred to as the superuser, administrative user, system administrator
          or just the root user has all the access to commands and system files in Linux.

3 /boot : Contains bootable files for linux that helps system to boot the device properly
          it basically checks POST (power on self test) process. Checks everey hardware of the
          device on self test mode if anything found not appropriate helps to power ON device.
          intimated by POP-UP notification. The boot directory contains Linux boot files such 
          as the bootloader, the kernel, and its associated files. Files such as ‘vmlinuz‘ 
          represent the compressed image of the Linux kernel.

4 /etc : Contains all configration files device all hardware information all services ,scripts
         are stored here. This directory works like nerve centre of the linux system.

5 /usr : By default other Software are installed in this memory.The /usr directory ranks as one of the most 
         important directories due to the enormous amount of data it holds. The directory contains 
         system-wide read-only files. These include libraries, user binaries and their documentation, 
         programs, and system utilities.

6 /bin : (Binary executable programs & common system commands) contains command used by all users.
         These include ls, pwd, cat, mkdir, cd, mv, cp, du,df, tar, rpm, wc, history, etc.

7 /sbin : (System Binary) All root user commmands are contnains in this directory.The /sbin directory 
          contains executable files, utilities, and system commands that are reserved for the root user 
          or a user with root privileges. Such commands include halt, reboot, mkfs, fsck, fdisk, halt, 
          iptables, ifconfig, ip, swapon, etc.

8 /opt : Optional directory reserved for add-on packages and third party software applications that are
         not included by default in the system official reposiroty.
         like when we install applications such as Skype, Discord, Spotify, and Java, G-chrome, to mention
         a few,they get stored in the /opt directory.

9 /Dev : Essential devices files or specical files that are attached to the system include terminal 
         devices like USB, Pointer, Printer (So called all peripheral devices).

10 /Var : The /var directory stores system-generated variable files, which include log files, caches, and 
          spool files.

11 /Proc : The /proc directory is somewhat of a strange directory. It is a virtual or pseudo filesystem 
           that contains vital information about running processes. It is considered the control and 
           information center for the Linux kernel. The filesystem is created on the fly upon system 
           startup and is destroyed once the system is powered off.

12 /mnt : This directory & its sub-directories intented to used as temporary  mount point for mounting 
          storage device for example :Hard disk drives, USB drives, and CDROMs.

13 /sys : The /sys is a virtual file system that contains a set of virtual files that provide an interface 
          to the Linux kernel.

14 /media : The /media directory is a directory where the system mounts removable media such as USB drives.

15 /run : The /run directory is a temporary filesystem that contains volatile runtime data that shows the 
          system has since it was booted. Files under the /run directory must be deleted 
          (removed or truncated as convenient) at the start of the boot process.

16 /tmp : The /tmp directory is a directory that stores temporary files and many programs use this 
          directory to create lock files and keep the temporary storage of data. Do not delete files under 
          the/tmp directory unless you know exactly what you we doing. Many of these files are critical 
          for presently running programs and removing them may affect a system crash.

17 /lib : The /lib directory stores all the essential standard libraries required by user binaries in the
          /bin directory.

18 /src : The /srv directory is the service directory and is abbreviated as ‘srv‘. This directory contains 
          server-specific and service-related files.

19 /lost+found : The lost+found directory is installed during the installation of Linux, useful for 
		 recovering files that may be broken due to unexpected shut-down.

In addition to the major directories, here is a list of some of the prominent files and directories and their uses:
===================================================================================================================


/boot/vmlinuz : The Linux Kernel file.
/dev/hda : Device file for the first IDE HDD (Hard Disk Drive).
/dev/hdc : Device file for the IDE Cdrom, commonly.

LOGIN PROCEDURE IN AMAZON LINUX
================================

steps are as follows:

* Register with email id on AWS console.
* Create EC2 Instance machine(server).
* Download putty Gen to generate private key
* Copy the EC2 public IP and enter it into putty
* Tap on SSH-Auth-Credentials-browse & upload the PPM machine key
* We will redirect on the AWs
* Start machine EC2 on AWS
* Go to putty paste the IP


LINUX COMMANDS AND ITS USE CASES
================================

CAT COMMAND : The cat command is one of the most universal tools, yet all it does is copy standard input
-----------   to standard output.
	Cat create file : Used to create single file
	cat concatenate file : To add more than one file into a single file
	cat copy files: To copy the content of X into Y file.
	tac : To see the cocntent of file from bottom to top approach.

* login as ec2-user
  [ec2-user@ip]$ sudo su  

	Sudo defines (super user do switch user) to become a root user we used sudo su
        $ represent Simple User     
               
* [root@ip]# cat >file1 

       Here cat used to create a file (i.e file1)
       # Represent Now Root User
       > Used for file creation and same time allow edit option to write in a file1
       we write 'Hello World' 

* cat >>file1 -Now double >> allow edit option in file1 (ctrl+D) for exit.
	"Namaste"
	(Ctrl+D)

* cat file1 - This will show the whole file1 content of it.

	It will show "Hello World"
		And   "Namaste"	
		(Ctrl+D -for exit)
	>>Dual indication mark only allow to add more lines or data. Can not use to delete previous data.

* cat >file2 
	"Thank You"
	 Ctrl+D (To exit)

* cat file1 file2 >All
	Here data of file1 & file2 will copy on new created file All
	Can see the data with the use of "cat all"
	It will show "Hello World"
	             "Namaste"
	             "Thank you"

TOUCH COMMAND
--------------
* Basically used to create a empty file
* Create multiple empty files
* Change all timstamp of a file
* Update only access time of a file, also can modify time of file.

	#touch file1
	#ls
Output would be - file1

	#touch file1 file2 file3 file4 (Here multiple file created in one go)
	#ls
Output would be - file1 file2 file3 file4

	#touch file2
	#touch -a file3
	#touch -m file4

TIMESTAMP - A timestamp is useful because it keeps records of when a file was accessed, modified,
---------   or added. Linux's files have 3 timestamps recorded by the computer

* touch -a : atime Access time(Last time when a file was access).
* touch -m : mtime Modify time (Last time when a file was modified).
* touch -u : ctime change time (Last time when file metadata was changed)
* stat filename : This will represent all timestamp of file like access, modify & change time.

mtime: ls -l test.txt   (Modify time)
ctime: ls -cl test.txt  (change time)
atime: ls -ul test.txt  (Access time)

VI & VIM EDITOR IN LINUX  : Vi editor is a powerful and widely used text editor in UNIX and Linux 
=========================   operating system. It allows us to create, edit and manage text files. 
                            Vim is the advanced version of vi editor. There are three modes in vi:
                            Command mode, Last Line Mode and Insert Mode.

* A program text editor
* It can be used to edit all kind of plain text, speciallyh useful for editing programs mainly used 
  used for unix programs.

Note: :W - To save
      :wq or :X - To saave & Quit.
      :Q - Quit
      :Q! - Force Quit, NO save here.

* Vi is standard whereas 'nano' has to be available depending on the linux we use.
	# vi file1 (Press I to insert editor cursor)
	# "hello & welcome"   (press Esc to exit)
	:wq  (Quit from Vi editor)  
	#ls
	output would be :- File 1
	#cat file1
	output : Hello & welcome

NANO COMMAND IN LINUX : It is also used to create and edit of a file, as it is also called editor
----------------------  

	# Nano file1 (file creation here)
	# 'Hello'
	  'Namaste'  (It consist content of file)
	Ctrl+X - Y (Y to save the content)
	# ls  (to list the file)
	# Renter content in file1, then 
	# Nano file1
	  'Hello'
	  'Namaste'
	  'thank you'
	Ctrl+O (Content overload here)
	Ctrl+X- Y (To save and exit)

Note : Cat & touch mainly used for file creation and Vi,Vim,nano used as file editor.

HOW TO CREATE A FILE OR DIRECTORY IN LINUX
-------------------------------------------

* Sudo su :(To convert general user into admin user)
* cat file1: To display the content of a file1
* less file1: Shows the contents of the file1
	* what is the advantage of using less command
	can easily read big files
	Forward and backcward search is easy
	Navigation from top to bottom nis easy

* more file1: Shows the contents of the file1
* shutdown -r +5 : Here system will (r)restart after (+5) five minutes as indicated. and shutdown in specific time will be notified.
* shutdown -c: To cancel the shutdown used (c).
* shutdown -h 22:00 : Here system shall not be available after 10AM as timer set in the shutdown command.
* Mkdir Dir1 : (Use mkdir To create a directory or folder) ex: Dir1 created here.
* mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 : Here multiple directories created within a single directory                          
* Ls : List the all files and directory.
	* ls -a : It will how -a all files that are even hidden too.
	* ll : List the names of the files in the current directory along with the 
	       permissions, date, time and size
	* LL : This is used to represent all created files history.(List of history).
	* Ls -La : Used to show all file & directories even hidden also.
	* Ls -L : Used to show the all files or folders.
	* Ls -LL: Its work likewise same as Ls -La.
  	  Represent like: |d|rwx|r_x|r_ _|
	* getfacl file_name (To represent file, user, group details)
	* ls -li : Inode is an index node. It serves as a unique identifier for a specific piecec of metadata
		   on a given filesystem.
* Dir1 : Folder means directory in linux.
* cd : change directory it will change the directory one to another.
* Cd dir2 : Change directory. Here directory will change and will enter in dir2.
* Cd .. : This will take back on previous directory(..) double dotted means one step back.
* cd~ : Quick access/reference to your home directory.
* pwd : It will show the present working directory or print working directory.
	Type (pwd) then output would be
	/home/ec2-user/dir1/dir2/dir3

* cd ../../.. : This command directly take back us from dir3 to dir1
		(3 steps back as we used double dots..three times).
* touch file1 : Touch used to create empty file i.e. file1.
* touch file1 file2 file3 file4 : Here four files created in a single shot.
* touch.file1 : Here (.) used to to make hidden file.
* mkdir.dir1 : Here a hidden directory created.
* touch -a : atime Access time(Last time when a file was access).
* touch -m : mtime Modify time (Last time when a file was modified).
* touch -u : ctime change time (Last time when file metadata was changed)
* stat filename : This will represent all timestamp of file like access, modify & change time.

* cp file1 file2 : cp is used to copy (Here content of file1 copy in file2).
   |	|     |	
(copy)(source)(Destination)

* mv  file1 dir1: Move to file1 into directory1.
   |     |	|
(Move) (File1) (Directory1)

* Ctrl+D : To save the content in the file and exit.
* Ctrl+L : To clcear the screen.
* mv file1 myfile : (mv) used to move or renaming. 
   |    |       |
(Rename)(file1)(New name or file)
 	Here, The file1 renamed with myfile with copy of data.
* mkdir dirx diry .dirz : Here dirz is hidden and rest two directories are shoews like 
  			  other general directories.
* rmdir : This command is used to remov the specified directory(mainly empty directory).
* rmdir -p : Here remove both the parent & child directory.
* rmdir -pv : Removes all he parent & subdirectories along with the verbase.
* rm -rf : Removes even non empth file & directory so called forcefully deletion.
* rm -rp : Rermoves non-empty directories including parent & subdirectory.
* rm -r : Removes empty directories.
* rm -rf dir2 : It will be forcefully deleted.
* If (D) shows in permission block or list details at beginning that means it is a directory.

* Hostname -i: To show only IP.
* Ifconfig: It will show IP address ,ethport, and interface card.
* ip addr : This will also show the ip address of linux machine.
* netstat -ie: It will work same like ifconfig show ethport,interface card.
* cat /etc/os-release* : Star here used if dont now the absolute path.
      |
  (Top level root directory) It will show the OS name and path.

YUM : Yellowdog updater modified. It is basically used to provide packages innstaall 
----  In a GNeneral term , It allow user & administarator to easily install ,update,remove or search
      software packages on a system.
* Yum insaatll httpd -Y : httpd used to install apache server. Here yum used for installation & httpd
                          is a apache package & (-Y) to provide consent yes to insatll.
* yum remove httpd -y : To remove the httpd
* yum update httpd -y : This will update all the files and packages.
* service httpd start : To start the httpd service web server.
* service httpd status : To show current status of serve active or inactive.
* chkconfig httpd ON: It help to turn ON httpd service whenever we start our machine.
* chkonfig httpd off: Turn of this service.
* whoami : Use to show whether root or simple user.
* which git,chef,tree: Use to show it is installed in the system or not.
* yum list installed will show whatever software package we installed till the time.
* echo "Hello" >file1 : Use to print or reflect the message.
	echo "Thank you" >>file1 : Now both previous & current content add now & show
	output: Hello
		Thank you

* yum insall tree -y : Here tree is installing to see all file & directories in tree hierarchy format. 
* Tree : List all the directory in tree format .It is working same alike list.
* Sort : Use to make content in ascecnding order of file likewise in a list way.
	for example: Cat >>file1 
		     S,A,R,T,L,M,O
		     sort file1
		     A,L,M,O,R,S,T
* useradd nitin : Use to add user to access or give rights. (To check) cat /etc/passwd.
* userdel -r nitin : Use this command to delete the user (-r) used to recursivev.It will delete all the data of nitin.
* passwd -L nitin : Here L is used to lock the user nitin.
* passwd -u nitin : Here (-u) used to unlock the nitin user.
* chage -M 90 nitin : Here (M)defines the days for nitin user but this will not warn about password expiration in 90 days.
* chage -W 3 nitin : Here (W) refers to warning 3 days before the expiry of password.
* chage -L nitin : To check the details.
* groupadd skan : To add new group. (To check) cat /etc/group.
* gpasswd -a Nick skan : This command vuse to add new user in same group (-a) used to add single user.
	      |      |
	  (New user)(group)


* gpasswd -m ajay,vijay skan : Here -m helps to add ultiple user at the same time in existing group.
	(To check output) cat /etc/group : Here it will show all user that we had created till the time.
* Ln -s : Softlink or shortcut. This softlink is use to create a shortcut of a file on desktop or somewhere
	  on a machine. seems (Ln) here abbrevate as (link) & (-s) denote softlink.
	syntax: Ln -s file1 soft file1 (We can give any name.)
	      (Ln-Link, -s - softlink, file1-mainfile, soft file1 - softlinik created with soft file1 name).
* Ln : This is hardlink (Alwasy used to create a backup of a file).
 	syntax: Ln file2 backup file2 {Here file2 backup created with the bame we given backup file2}.
		|      |      |     |
	    (Link)(Mainfile)(backup)(file)
	lets understand all this with one more example-
* cat >>file2 
  "New india establishment"
  cat file2 {Now if we will see then the new content "New india establishment" along with previous added data
  will show here in backup file too. All data will reflect in both files main file as well as backup file.}

* Tar : Tar file used to merge multiple file into single file(Primary moto is to merge the files).
* tar -cvf dir1.tar dirx: 
  (-c denote to create, v stands for -verbose, f stands forcefully, dir1.tar- outputfile dirx- mainfile).
  (In above syntax main file is dirx & its sub files, directory will merge in dir1.tar)
* gzip : (GNU zip) is a compressing tool, which is used to truncate the file size. by default original file
  will be replaced by the compressed file ending with extension (.gz). Aim of command to compress file size.
  syntax : gzip dirx.tar
           Ls (list) 
           dirx.tar.gz (.gz here represent zip status).
* gunzip : On other hand to decompress the file we use gunzip command and our original file will be back.
  syntax : gunzip dirx.tar.gz
          Ls (List)
          dirx.tar
* In general, GZIP is much better compared to ZIP, In terms of compression, especially when compressing a huge
  number of files. The common practice with GZIP, is to archive all the files into a single tarball before
  compression. In ZIP files, the individual files are compressed and then added to the archive.
* tar -xvf dirx.tar :if we want to remove .tar then use -xvf command to remove .tar from its name.
  (-x denotes extract, v stands for verbrose, f stands forcefully, dirx.tar stands file name)

* Wget : Non interactive network downloader in simple words it is used to download software package or file 
         through link.
  syntax: wget <url> - Url provided & then it will start downloading.
  If network is slow and interupting on regular intervals than also its continuously trying to download the
  package reason its so called powerfull command.

* Head & tail : Both the head and the tail commands are members of the GNU coreutils package. 
               They are, by default, installed in all Linux distributions. 
	syntax: cat >file8
		1
 		2
		3
		4   |
		5   |
		6   |
		7   |-------> (Content of a file)
		8   |
		9   |
		10  |
		11	
		12
		13
		14
		15
* head file8: As their names imply, the head command will output the first 10 lines of the file.
* tail file8: The tail command will print the last 10 lines of the file.
* sort : Means it will sort the file content on ascending order.
	sytax: cat >>file10  (Here one file created with the name of file10)
		Naman  |
		vijay  -----> (Content of file10)
		Ajay   |
		drisha |
* sort file10 : then it will show the content in ascending format with first letter consideration.
		Ajay	|
		drisha	|
		Naman	|-----> (Output comes in ascending order format)

* netstat : Linux netstat command stands for Network statistics. It displays information 
	    about different interface statistics, including open sockets, routing tables, 
	    and connection information

	syntax: netstat -a (To show both listening & non listening sockets)
		netstat -at (To list all TCP ports)
		netstat -au (List all UDP ports)
		netstat -l (List only all listenting ports)
		netstat -lt (List only all listening TCP ports)
		netstat -lu : To list only the listening udp ports
		netstat -lx : To list only the listening UNIX ports.
		netstat -s : To list the statistics for all ports.
		netstat -st(TCP) : To list the statistics for TCP ports.
		netstat -su(UDP) : List the statistics for UDP ports
		netstat -pt : To display the PID and program names
		netstat -c : To print the netstat information continuously
		netstat --verbose : To get the non-supportive address families in the system
		netstat -r : To get the kernel routing information

ACCESS MODE/ PERMISSIONS:
==========================
sset of permissions provides a number for that set.

Number	Octal Permission Representation      				Ref
0	No permission							---
1	Execute permission						--x
2	Write permission						-w-
3	Execute and write permission: 1 (execute) + 2 (write) = 3	-wx
4	Read permission							r--
5	Read and execute permission: 4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5		r-x
6	Read and write permission: 4 (read) + 2 (write) = 6		rw-
7	All permissions: 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7		rwx

COMMANDS:
---------

* chown − The chown command stands for "change owner" and is used to change the owner of a file/directory.
	syntax : chown user file
		|        |    |_______
				      ^
 	(Change owner) (user name) (file or directory/name)
* chmod : Used to chcange the access mode of a file.
* chgrp − The chgrp command stands for "change group" and is used to change the group of a file/directory.
	syntax : chgrp group filelist
		   |      |         |
	   (change group)(Group name) (file or directory list)
NOTE − The super user, root, has the unrestricted capability to change the ownership of any file but 
       normal users can change the ownership of only those files that they own.
* chgrp: 
                      ----------------------
	For example:  |d | rwx | r_x | r_ _|
                      ----------------------
                       |     |     |     |
               (Directory)(Owner)(group)(Others)
	r = Denotes to 4
	w = Denotes to 2
	x = Denotes to 1
	(rwx) = 4+2+1 = 7

	syntax: mkdir dir1 (one directory created by the name of file1)
		chmod 777dir1 (All permissions given to dir1 i.e. read,write ,execute)
		ls -l 	(List all files)

* Grep : Grep stands for "Global Regular Expressions Print" basically used to search a particular 
	 keyword or name with in given file.
	 grep used to search a single keyword or name with a declared file.
	 syntax: grep nick file1
		(Here nick is name or keyword that will search in whole file1)

* grep -E: Its work like same as Egrep but processing quite slow comparable to egrep.

* Egrep : "Extended Global Regular Expressions Print" command is a text processing tool 
          that searches for patterns or regular expressions in a specified location. 
          The tool provides the same output as grep -E , but works faster.
	  
 	  In egrep, We can search for more than one strings at same time 
	  for example : egrep "key1|key2|key3|key4"
	  syntax : egrep "Nick|adam" csv1
 	  	   (egrep then "nick and adam" string will search in file csv).

* head -5 file1 : Used to read top 5 lines of a file.
* head -3 file1 : used to read top 3 lines of a file.
* tail -5 file1 : used to read last 5 lines in a file.
* locate csv1 : locate is used for obtaining instantaneous results, and it is an essential utility 
	        when speed is a priority. It is only search in database rather to search whole filesystem.
* wc : Word count used to count words in a line, byte and character count
  	wc -l – Prints the number of lines in a file.
  	wc -w – prints the number of words in a file.
  	wc -c – Displays the count of bytes in a file.
  	wc -m – prints the count of characters from a file.
  	wc -L – prints only the length of the longest line in a file.
* | : This pipeline used to combine two commands and redirect the output in to command2.
	syntax: command1 | command2
	* ; : semicolon also used to add commands one after another.
	* && : Also combine two commands using & symbol between the two or many.

* shred: The shred command helps to overwrite the data in place several times. This makes it 
 	 harder for third party software and hardware probing to recover the data. 
	 That is why it's commonly used to securely remove data.
	* shred -u file_name : Use the shred command helps to permanently delete a file which is unable to recover.
	* shred --remove file_name
	* shred -v stands for verbose and gives detailed output.
	* shred -z replaces the final pass with zeros to hide shredding.
	* shred -u removes the file after shredding. We don't need to remove file afterwards using 
		   rm with this flag.
	* shred -n changes the number of passes. We have set it to 5.

* dmidecode and lscpu : Both command helps to check system architecture info in details.
* cat file1 file2 >file3 : File1 and file2 merger or combined in file3.
* file file1:  It is used to find out type of file
* sort file1 : Used to sort the file content.
* cat file1 | sort: Its also used to provide the same result sorting of content of file1
* git bash : Used to access a linux server remotely from a windows machine.
	* putty: It is also works the same way.
	* cmd : Also used to access machine remotely.
* command > file1 : This command used to store the output of a command in a file.
* cron : cron used to automate any task or script. according to this we will provide a specific time
	 at that time it will automatically relsease that set of code or script to perform a particular task.
* crontab -l : Used to check scheduled jobs.
* check /var/log/messages : Used to check if cron job didnt excute or worked.
* httpd,sshd,chronyd : All becomes in daemon series which keep runing in background everytime.
* systemctl status httpd: To check the status of that paritular httpd service is runing or not.
