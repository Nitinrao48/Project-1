Stroage are categorize in couple of types in AWS. Some of describe below

AWS Storage
* Simple storage service so called S3 also.
* Elastic file storage.
* Elastic block storage.
* Glacier now it is called S3 also.
* Snowball.

->Snowball is a physical kind of stroge primarily used to migrate physical data to over the cloud.
 Lets undertand with taking a example: If we have a one physical production server in our premise and now we want to store
 it on cloud machine. so we will generate a request for data migration snowball storage from AWS team they will send it
 via courier and once our data will copy into it then we will send it back to their location and their team then trasnfer
 this data on cloud machines.
 And after all this our data will available on cloud we can acess it after a schedule time.

->Glacicer : Its is a very cheap kind of storage that is now called S3 glacier it cost us very minimal if we opt this
  Here we mainly store the data that is rarely need us .Like once in a while because its access speed is slow as compare
  to other stroage available in AWS.

->Elastic block storage (EBS): It is so called storage that attached with server/node/or EC2 Machines . No body can access
  it without start or login the EC2 machine becuase its in block form and attached with server .so every time whenever
  want to access the storage or data we must need to login in instance machine first.
->Elastic File storage (EFS) : This is used to store the structured type of data and mainly used to store the data in file
  format . And always support only linux machines data. It stores like file configuration, new patches and more.
->Simple storage service (S3): As name implies simple storage service is the main storage offered and comes under AWS. This
  standard storage. it is also used to store the main data. Like if we want to host our website so we can store our code
  or data in this storage to access the website here accessing storage charges are minimal so either we can use it as
  website or app hosting .Keep it in mind that we can not deploy the OS operating system in this storage. only data in 
  bulk form we can store it as it is. Like data structured or unstructured graph any kind of form. that why it is so called
  standard storage offered by AWS.
  Here can store any data type format either file, In graph form, big block type and lot more.

Furtheremore, Categorization of new AWS storage
1 AWS S3 Simple storage service
2 AWS S3 Glacier deep archival
3 AWS S3 Glacier
4 AWS S3 IA (Infrequent Access)
5 AWS S3 one-zone (IA)
6 AWS S3 Intelligent Access

The aforesaid all are new storage services offered by AWS nowdays. They are more defined below.

->FEATURES OF S3
  * Store KB to TB of data in one run. Accessing or retreiving of data here is much easier and convenient via http or https
  * Data storage More than 5GB will be store in form of block. We dont need to worry AWS own do this logically.
  * Data redundancy here in form of ZONE like storage store at 3 zones 
  * Availability of data 99.9% (SLA).
  * Data is constlier to store here .Retreiving data cost is cheaper

-->FEATURES OF AWS S3
  It store the data of any type of.
  Store the data in small chunks that will represent in S3 bucket in form of main block storage.
  Retriving of data is very fast and cheap but storing of data is costly as compared to other storage services offered by AWS.
-->FEATURES OF AWS Glacier
   It is the cheapest storage offered by AWS
   store the data that would need rarely.
   This is widely used in data storing companies like sony,T-series to storing their songs recording that rarely needed by them like once in a while.   
-->FEATURES OF AWS Glacier Deep Archival
   It is another storage service working in same module like glacier.
   It is more often needed when need to hide or archive the data.
   It store the data in deep archive method always.
-->FEATURES OF AWS IA Infrequent Access
   That is widely used to when data not required daily or frequently
   Data when needed once or twice in a month that stored in S3 IA infrequent Access    
   It is comparitevely cheaper to standard S3 but data retreiving is costly in this storage.
   This is gud when data not frequently required 
-->FEATURES OF AWS one-zone IA
   This storage is widely famous and used to store the data at single location or in one zone.
   This is used to those who have their setup in data center and for replication stored at this storage for wider range.
   Its provide the data redundancy or SLA 99.5%
-->FEATURES OF AWS S3 intelligent access
   This storage is automatically store the data in between S3 to IA storage according to the user need and working style.
   Its also called Intelligent sensing for our storage.
   THis is mainly used by vaourios e-commerce paltform companies to use it once needed it can handle by own without user intereption or manually interact.
